Opulence uses a single point of entry for all pages.  In other words, all HTTP requests get redirected through *index.php*, which instantiates the application and handles the request.  Here's a breakdown of the workflow of a typical Opulence HTTP application:

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

1. User requests http://www.example.com/users/23/profile
2. Your virtual host redirects the request through http://www.example.com/index.php
3. *bootstrap/http/start.php* is loaded, which instantiates an `Application` object
4. Various configs are read, and [bootstrappers](bootstrappers) are registered
5. [Pre-start tasks](application#pre-start-tasks) are run
  1. Bootstrappers' bindings are registered by the bootstrapper `Dispatcher`
  2. Bootstrappers are run by the bootstrapper `Dispatcher`
6. The application is [started](application#start-task)
7. An HTTP `Kernel` is instantiated, which converts the [HTTP request](http-requests-responses#requests) into a [response](http-requests-responses#responses)
  * The path "/users/23/profile" is detected by the request
8. All global [middleware](http-middleware) are run
9. The [`Router`](routing) finds a route that matches the request
  * The user Id 23 is extracted from the URL here
10. The `Dispatcher` runs any [middleware](http-middleware) registered specifically to this route
11. The `Dispatcher` dispatches the request to the `Controller`
  * The user Id is injected into the controller method
12. The `Controller` processes data from the request, updates/retrieves any appropriate models, and creates a `Response`
13. The `Response` is sent back to the user
14. [Post-start tasks](application#post-start-tasks) are run
15. [Pre-shutdown tasks](application#pre-shutdown-tasks) are run
16. The application is [shut down](application#shutdown-task)
17. [Post-shutdown tasks](application#post-shutdown-tasks) are run
