<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
**Units of work** act as transactions across multiple repositories.  They also schedule entity updates/insertions/deletions in the data mappers.  The benefits of using units of work include:

1. Transactions across multiple repositories can be rolled back, giving you "all or nothing" functionality
2. Changes made to entities retrieved by repositories are automatically checked for changes and, if any are found, scheduled for updating when the unit of work is committed
3. Database writes are queued and executed all at once when the unit of work is committed, giving you better performance than executing writes throughout the lifetime of the application
4. Querying for the same object will always give you the same, single instance of that object

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
 Let's take a look at how units of work can manage entities retrieved through repositories:
```php
use MyApp\Orm\DataMappers\MyDataMapper;
use Opulence\Orm\ChangeTracking\ChangeTracker;
use Opulence\Orm\EntityRegistry;
use Opulence\Orm\Ids\Accessors\IdAccessorRegistry;
use Opulence\Orm\Ids\Generators\IdGeneratorRegistry;
use Opulence\Orm\Repositories\Repository;
use Opulence\Orm\UnitOfWork;

$idAccessorRegistry = new IdAccessorRegistry();
$idGeneratorRegistry = new IdGeneratorRegistry();
$changeTracker = new ChangeTracker();
$entityRegistry = new EntityRegistry($idAccessorRegistry, $changeTracker);
// Assume $connection was set previously
$unitOfWork = new UnitOfWork(
    $entityRegistry,
    $idAccessorRegistry,
    $idGeneratorRegistry,
    $changeTracker,
    $connection
);
$dataMapper = new MyDataMapper();
$users = new Repository("Opulence\\Users\\User", $dataMapper, $unitOfWork);

// Let's say we know that there's a user with Id 123 and username "foo" in the repository
$someUser = $users->getById(123);
echo $someUser->getUsername(); // "foo"

// Let's change his username
$someUser->setUsername('bar');
// Once we're done with our unit of work, just let it know you're ready to commit
// It'll automatically know what has changed and save those changes back to storage
$unitOfWork->commit();

// To prove that this really worked, let's print the name of the user now
echo $users->getById(123)->getUsername(); // "bar"
```

<h2 id="entity-registry">Entity Registry</h2>
Entities that are scheduled for insertion/deletion/update are managed by an `Opulence\Orm\EntityRegistry`.

<h4 id="aggregate-roots">Aggregate Roots</h4>
Let's say that when creating a user you also create a password object.  This password object has a reference to the user object's Id.  In this case, the user is what we call an **aggregate root** because without it, the password wouldn't exist.  It'd be perfectly reasonable to insert both of them in the same unit of work.  However, if you did this, you might be asking yourself "How do I get the Id of the user before storing the password?"  The answer is `registerAggregateRootCallback()`:
```php
// Order here matters: aggregate roots should be added before their children
$unitOfWork->scheduleForInsertion($user);
$unitOfWork->scheduleForInsertion($password);

// Pass in the aggregate root, the child, and the function that sets the aggregate root Id
$entityRegistry->registerAggregateRootCallback($user, $password, function ($user, $password) {
    // This will be executed after the user is inserted but before the password is inserted
    $password->setUserId($user->getId());
});

$unitOfWork->commit();
echo $password->getUserId() == $user->getId(); // 1
```

> **Note:** Aggregate root callbacks are executed for entities scheduled for insertion and update.

<h2 id="comparing-entities">Comparing Entities</h2>
`Opulence\Orm\ChangeTracking\ChangeTracker` is responsible for tracking any changes made to the entities it manages.  By default, it uses reflection, which for some classes might be slow.  To speed up the comparison between two objects to see if they're identical, you can use `registerComparator()`.

Let's say that all you care about when checking if two users are identical is whether or not their usernames are identical:

```php
use Opulence\Orm\ChangeTracking\ChangeTracker;
use Opulence\Orm\EntityRegistry;
use Opulence\Orm\Ids\Accessors\IdAccessorRegistry;
use Opulence\Orm\Ids\Generators\IdGeneratorRegistry;
use Opulence\Orm\UnitOfWork;

// Assume $connection was set previously
// Also assume the user object was already instantiated
$idAccessorRegistry = new IdAccessorRegistry();
$idGeneratorRegistry = new IdGeneratorRegistry();
$changeTracker = new ChangeTracker();
$entityRegistry = new EntityRegistry($idAccessorRegistry, $changeTracker);
$unitOfWork = new UnitOfWork(
    $entityRegistry,
    $idAccessorRegistry,
    $idGeneratorRegistry,
    $changeTracker,
    $connection
);
$className = $entityRegistry->getClassName($user);
$entityRegistry->manageEntity($user);
$user->setUsername('newUsername');

// Register a function that compares the usernames of two user objects
$changeTracker->registerComparator($className, function ($userA, $userB) {
    return $userA->getUsername() == $userB->getUsername();
});

// On commit, the change tracker will run the comparison function
// It will determine that the $user's username has changed
// So, it will be scheduled for update and committed
$unitOfWork->commit();
```
> **Note:** PHP's `clone` feature performs a shallow clone.  In other words, it only clones the object, but not any objects contained in that object.  If your object contains another object and you'd like to take advantage of automatic change tracking, you must write a `__clone()` method for that class to clone any objects it contains.  Otherwise, the automatic change tracking will not pick up on changes made to the objects contained in other objects.

<h2 id="entity-ids">Entity Ids</h2>

<h4 id="id-accessors">Id Accessors</h4>
Opulence lets you use plain-old PHP objects with the ORM, which means Opulence doesn't know which methods to call to get and set the unique identifiers in your classes.  So, you must let Opulence know using the `Opulence\Orm\Ids\Accessors\IdAccessorRegistry`:

```php
use Opulence\Orm\ChangeTracking\ChangeTracker;
use Opulence\Orm\EntityRegistry;
use Opulence\Orm\Ids\Accessors\IdAccessorRegistry;

class Foo
{
    private $id;

    public function getId()
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    public function setId($id)
    {
        $this->id = $id;
    }
}

$idAccessorRegistry = new IdAccessorRegistry();
$entityRegistry = new EntityRegistry($idAccessorRegistry, new ChangeTracker());
// Accepts the entity and must return the identifier
$getter = function ($entity) {
    return $entity->getId();
};
// Accepts the entity and identifier and must set the new identifier
$setter = function ($entity, $id) {
    $entity->setId($id);
};

$idAccessorRegistry->registerIdAccessors(Foo::class, $getter, $setter);
```

`registerIdAccessors()` also accepts an array of class names.

To use the accessor registry in your unit of work, pass it into the unit of work constructor.

> **Note:**  You must always register Id getters, but Id setters are optional.

> **Note:**  If you're using the <a href="https://github.com/opulencephp/Project" target="_blank">skeleton project</a>, you can set your Id accessors in `Project\Bootstrappers\Orm\UnitOfWorkBootstrapper::registerIdAccessors()`.

If you don't have getter/setter methods for your Id, you can use reflection to get/set it using `registerReflectionIdAccessors()`:

```php
namespace MyApp\Orm;

use Opulence\Orm\Ids\Accessors\IdAccessorRegistry;

class User
{
    private $id = -1;
}

$idAccessorRegistry = new IdAccessorRegistry();
// The second parameter is the name of the Id property in the User class
$idAccessorRegistry->registerReflectionIdAccessors(User::class, 'id');
```

<h5 id="reducing-boilerplate-code">Reducing Boilerplate Code</h5>
Opulence's flexibility comes at the price of a little bit of boilerplate code on your end to register Id accessors.  However, if you want to get rid of the boilerplate code, you can optionally implement `Opulence\Orm\IEntity`, which has two methods:  `getId()` and `setId($id)`.  Classes that implement `IEntity` automatically have their Id accessors registered.

<h4 id="id-generators">Id Generators</h4>
Opulence can automatically generate Ids for entities managed by the unit of work.  A common way of setting Ids is using sequences from your database.  In this case, you can use:

* `Opulence\Orm\Ids\Generators\BigIntSequenceGenerator`
  * Generates big integer sequence Ids
* `Opulence\Orm\Ids\Generators\IntSequenceGenerator`
  * Generates integer sequence Ids
* `Opulence\Orm\Ids\Generators\UuidV4Generator`
  * Generates UUIDs, which are suitable for distributed databases

All Id generators in Opulence implement `Opulence\Orm\Ids\Generators\IIdGenerator`, which has two methods:

* `generate()`
  * Generates a new Id for the input entity
* `getEmptyValue()`
  * Gets the value of an Id that is considered empty
* `isPostInsert()`
  * Whether or not this generator should be run before or after the unit of work executes its inserts

To let the unit of work know which Id generator to use with your classes, register them to `Opulence\Orm\Ids\Generators\IdGeneratorRegistry`:

```php
use MyApp\User;
use Opulence\Orm\Ids\Generators\IdGeneratorRegistry;
use Opulence\Orm\Ids\Generators\IntSequenceIdGenerator;

$idGeneratorRegistry = new IdGeneratorRegistry();
$idGeneratorRegistry->registerIdGenerator(
    User::class,
    new IntSequenceIdGenerator('user_id_seq')
);
```

Then, pass `$idGeneratorRegistry` into the unit of work constructor, and you're set.

> **Note:**  If you're using the <a href="https://github.com/opulencephp/Project" target="_blank">skeleton project</a>, you can set your Id generators in `Project\Bootstrappers\Orm\UnitOfWorkBootstrapper::registerIdGenerators()`.
