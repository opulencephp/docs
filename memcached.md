<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
Memcached (pronounced "Mem-cash-dee") is a distributed memory cache with basic key-value store functionality.  Although it doesn't come with all the bells and whistles of Redis, it does offer faster speed, which is suitable for simple key-value data.  For more information, <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php" target="_blank">read the official PHP documentation</a>.

<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>
Opulence lets you choose whichever Memcached library you'd like.  The built-in library `\Memcached` is the most popular.

<h2 id="creating-memcached-connection">Creating a Memcached Connection</h2>
`Opulence\Memcached\Memcached` acts as a convenient wrapper around Memcached.  It accepts either a single client or a list of clients.  Opulence uses magic methods to pass on method calls to the underlying Memcached client(s).

<h4 id="single-client">Single Client</h4>
```php
use Memcached as Client;
use Opulence\Memcached\Memcached;

// Create our connection
$client = new Client();
$client->addServer('localhost', 11211);
$memcached = new Memcached($client);

// Try it out
$memcached->set('foo', 'bar');
echo $memcached->get('foo'); // "bar"
```

You can get the client instance:

```php
$memcached->getClient();
```

<h4 id="multiple-clients">Multiple Clients</h4>
If you pass in multiple clients, one of them MUST be named `default`.

```php
use Memcached as Client;
use Opulence\Memcached\Memcached;

$defaultClient = new Client();
$defaultClient->addServer('127.0.0.1', 11211);
$backupClient = new Client();
$backupClient->addServer('127.0.0.2', 11211);
$clients = [
    'default' => $defaultClient,
    'backup' => $backupClient
];
$memcached = new Memcached($clients);
```

You can get a particular client instance:

```php
$memcached->getClient('backup');
```

> **Note:** The `default` client will always be used unless you call `getClient($name)` and make calls to that client directly.

<h4 id="server-pools">Server Pools</h4>
`\Memcached` allows you to add multiple servers to a client:

```php
use Memcached as Client;
use Opulence\Memcached\Memcached;

$client = new Client();
$client->addServer('127.0.0.1', 11211);
$client->addServer('127.0.0.2', 11211);
$memcached = new Memcached($client);
```

You can get the client instance:

```php
$memcached->getClient();
```

<h2 id="type-mappers">Type Mappers</h2>
`Opulence\Memcached\Types\TypeMapper` helps you translate to and from Memcached data types.  For example, you cannot store a `DateTime` object in Memcached, so you need to convert to a Unix timestamp when storing it.  Conversely, when you read from Memcached, you can use a type mapper to convert the Unix timestamp back into a `DateTime` object.
You can also use a factory to create type mappers:

```php
use Opulence\Memcached\Types\Factories\TypeMapperFactory;

$typeMapper = (new TypeMapperFactory)->createTypeMapper();
```

<h4 id="booleans">Booleans</h4>

##### To Memcached
```php
$phpBoolean = true;
echo $typeMapper->toMemcachedBoolean($phpBoolean); // 1
```

##### From Memcached
```php
$memcachedBoolean = 1;
echo $typeMapper->fromMemcachedBoolean($memcachedBoolean) === true; // 1
```

<h4 id="timestamps">Timestamps</h4>

##### To Memcached
```php
$phpDate = new DateTime('1987-07-24 12:34:56');
echo $typeMapper->toMemcachedTimestamp($phpDate); // 554128496
```

> **Note:** This method accepts any object implementing `DateTimeInterface`, including `DateTimeImmutable`.

##### From Memcached
```php
$memcachedDate = 554128496;
$phpDate = $typeMapper->fromMemcachedTimestamp($memcachedDate);
echo $phpDate->format('Y-m-d'); // "1987-07-24"
```
