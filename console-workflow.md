Apex uses a single point of entry for console applications.  When typing `php apex` into the console, the `apex` bash file is executed, which instantiates the application and handles the request.  Here's a breakdown of the workflow of a typical Apex console application:

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

1. User types `php apex foo bar --baz=blah`
2. `apex` bash script loads *bootstrap/console/start.php*, which instantiates an `Application` object
3. Various configs are read, and [bootstrappers](bootstrappers) are registered
4. [Pre-start tasks](application#pre-start-tasks) are run
  1. Bootstrappers' bindings are registered by the bootstrapper `Dispatcher`
  2. Bootstrappers are run by the bootstrapper `Dispatcher`
5. The application is [started](application#start-task)
6. A console `Kernel` is instantiated with a request parser, the raw string input, and the [response](console-requests-responses#responses) to write output to
7. The `Kernel` uses the request parser to parse the input into a `Request` object
  * This contains the command name ("foo") and any arguments ("bar") and options ("--baz=blah")
8. The command class whose `name` property matches the input command name is instantiated
9. A command compiler compiles the command with the `Request`
10. The command is executed
11. A response compiler compiles any output produced by the command
  * A lexer lexes the raw response into a stream of tokens
  * A parser converts the tokens into an abstract syntax tree
  * The compiler compiles the abstract syntax tree into ANSI codes used to style the output
12. Output is written to the kernel's `Response`, and the command's status code is returned
13. [Post-start tasks](application#post-start-tasks) are run
14. [Pre-shutdown tasks](application#pre-shutdown-tasks) are run
15. The application is [shut down](application#shutdown-task)
16. [Post-shutdown tasks](application#post-shutdown-tasks) are run
